## Vision
Based on Aruco Marker system, use opencv marker detection algorithm to get the relative distance to the marker in x,y,z three dimensions.

## Control
Taking PID as our basic control algorithm, we adapted two control schemes: 
1. simultaneous x,y,z velocity control 
2. only control x,y velocity before reaching to a certain range of the marker and then incorporate z control into the whole control system.

## State Estimation
Based on kalman filter, we only estimate the relative distance in x,y.

## ROS system
Integrate the above modules on ROS framework and take simulation test in Gazebo world.
